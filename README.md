# Oyster monorepo

Monorepo for the Oyster platform.

## Organization

The repository is organized into projects:

- [attestation/server](./attestation/server/): Attestation server that uses the NSM API to generate attestations.
- [attestation/server-custom](./attestation/server-custom/): Attestation server that uses the NSM API to generate attestations and accepts query parameters for customizing attestation fields.
- [attestation/server-custom-mock](./attestation/server-custom-mock/): Attestation server that uses a local root of trust to generate attestations and accepts query parameters for customizing attestation fields.
- [attestation/server-mock](./attestation/server-mock/): Attestation server that uses a local root of trust to generate attestations.
- [attestation/verifier](./attestation/verifier/): Attestation verifier server that verifies attestations.
- [attestation/verifier-enclave](./attestation/verifier-enclave/): Attestation verifier enclave that packages the attestation verifier server.

## Project guidelines

Each project is expected to be owned, managed and licensed independently. Here's a quick checklist of items that are expected of every project:

- MUST have a README.md with detailed instructions
  - MUST cover what the project is about
  - MUST cover how to build and/or use it in the context of the monorepo
  - SHOULD cover how to build and/or use it as an independent component outside the monorepo
- MUST have a LICENSE.txt file with an appropriate license
- SHOULD have a Nix build file
- SHOULD be registered in the root flake

## Licensing

Each project picks its own license. Please refer to each project subdirectory for the same. In addition, each project might use external dependencies each of which have their own license.
